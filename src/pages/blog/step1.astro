    <p><strong>High yield:</strong> Download my supplementary Anki deck <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1LeIr7D2VgcAG02HKApjpACyDx_bxw8/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> or subscribe on Ankihub <a href="https://app.ankihub.net/accounts/login/?next=/decks/34317ca6-bba8-4c76-963f-b58439b63463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It includes 53 cards based on First Aid 2023 for distinguishing similar conditions.</p>

    <p>I started the Anking Step 1 deck in late August of first year, doing 150-200 new cards daily. I finished all new cards by late January and fully matured the deck by March. I completed UWorld from January to February, averaging 72%. I reviewed incorrect questions but found making Anki cards too time-consuming. A second pass wasn't useful since I remembered most questions and averaged 95%.</p>

    <p>UWorld provided deeper understanding and high-quality images missing from Anking, but didn't significantly improve my NBME scores, likely because NBMEs test surface-level content.</p>

    <p>In the three weeks before the exam, I read through First Aid 2023 and the first three chapters of Pathoma 2021.</p>

    <p>I took the test on April 4, 2023. It felt closest to NBME 31 and Free 120—similar difficulty to UWorld but less convoluted. NBMEs 25-30 were less representative. Question stems weren't longer than practice exams, and I finished each block in 40-50 minutes, similar to my NBMEs.</p>
